## üö© Why?
<p>I created Bloom Habits because, as someone with ADHD, I struggled to keep my goals, tasks, and daily habits organized in a way that actually worked for my brain. Writing things down helped me stay focused, but I wanted more‚Äîa tool designed specifically for people like me who need structure, visual feedback, and motivation. Bloom Habits is built to help users organize their thoughts and track their progress across goals, habits, and routines, all while making the process engaging with dynamic visuals, emotional AI journaling, and a beautifully designed interface. After seeing how much it helped me, I expanded it to help others stay on track, build healthy routines, and feel more in control of their lives.</p>

<h4 align='center'> How to use the Desktop Wallpaper </h4>
Once you have Wallpaper Engine running, navigate to its Change Wallpaper window. There you want to click "Open Wallpaper" and "Open From URL". When it asks for URL copy paste this link: "https://bloomhabits.com/wallpaper-engine?wallpaper=true" without the quotation marks. Keep in mind the "?wallpaper=true" part of the link is important, as it prevents the navbar and sidebars from showing.

&nbsp;

<h3 align='center'> Current-Time Marker on the Timeline</h3>
Although this addition may seem minor, it significantly enhances the functionality of the Habits Timeline. It provides immediate feedback on your daily progress, allowing you to easily identify which habit is coming up next and when, without the need to reference specific deadlines.
Graphic Design: Throughout the day, the tracker is represented by a vibrant sun, transitioning to a moon as evening approaches. This visual shift effectively marks the transition from day to night, offering a clear distinction between daytime and evening.
